It sounds like you've encountered an issue because you ran `git init` in a subdirectory after cloning a repository. Let me walk you through why this is happening and how to fix it.

### What likely happened:

1. **You cloned a repository**:
   When you clone a repository, Git sets up a `.git` directory in the root of the cloned repo. This `.git` directory contains all the necessary information to track the repository.

2. **You created a new folder**:
   Inside the cloned repository, you created a new folder. This is just a directory inside the already initialized Git repository, so Git is aware of it.

3. **You ran `git init` in the new folder**:
   Running `git init` inside the new folder initializes a **new Git repository** in that folder. Now, this folder has its own `.git` directory, making it a separate Git repository from the one you cloned.

4. **You tried pushing**:
   When you try to push code to the main branch, Git will attempt to push from the new repository, which doesn't have any connection to the original repository you cloned. Since the new Git repository doesn't know about the remote origin of the original repository, it results in an error.

### Solution:

You need to decide what you want to achieve:

#### Option 1: **Keep using the original repository and add files to the new folder**

1. **Go to the root of your cloned repository (the parent directory of the folder you created)**.
2. **Add the new folder** and its contents to the existing Git repository:
   ```bash
   git add <folder_name>  # Add the folder and its contents
   git commit -m "Add new folder with files"
   git push origin main  # Push to the main branch of the original repo
   ```

#### Option 2: **Start a completely new Git repository in the new folder**

If you intended to create a completely separate Git repository in the new folder and push it to a new remote repository, follow these steps:

1. **Remove the `.git` directory** from the new folder (this is what was created when you ran `git init` in the folder):
   ```bash
   rm -rf <folder_name>/.git  # Remove the nested .git directory
   ```
2. **Go back to the root of the original repo** and commit the changes as usual:
   ```bash
   git add <folder_name>  # Add the folder and its contents
   git commit -m "Add new folder with files"
   git push origin main  # Push to the main branch of the original repo
   ```

3. **If you need a separate remote repository**:
   - Navigate to the new folder and reinitialize the Git repository:
     ```bash
     cd <folder_name>
     git init
     git remote add origin <new_repo_url>  # Point to the new remote repository URL
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     git push -u origin main  # Push to the new remote repository
     ```

### Common Errors and Troubleshooting:

- **Fatal error: "remote origin already exists"**: This happens if you've tried to add a remote while having conflicting configurations. You can check your remotes by running `git remote -v`. If necessary, you can remove and re-add the remote:
  ```bash
  git remote remove origin
  git remote add origin <new_repo_url>
  ```
